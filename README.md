# COMP 321 project 4 part 1 - starter program
Code Authors: Amber, Elias, and Rup.
####Purpose:
This basic Go program mimics the popular Hangman game where users guess the letters of a word
and try to reveal the whole word before making too many wrong guesses.

####Instructions for running:
This program can be freely run with VSCode or GoLand, a Jetbrains IDE. In either case, you will first need to
install Go from here: https://golang.org/doc/install.

For GoLand, read through https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/quick-start-guide-goland.html and clone
the repository. If it's not working, you may need to configure the GOROOT and GOPATH - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-goroot-and-gopath.html


For VSCode, install the Go extension and clone the repository.

Documentation and guides for using Go can be found elsewhere in the websites linked above.
